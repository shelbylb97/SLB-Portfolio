# SLB-Portfolio
### Homework for week 2
=========================

<p> This is my current portfolio using both CSS and HTML. Clearly has some debugging and stylesheet work still to do. The nav inks all work, including the "see my work" button, the refactory link in the portfolio section will take you to last weeks homework assignment, however the other links are just examples for now. The site should be mobile-friendly.
